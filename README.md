# Descartes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sjkelly/Descartes.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sjkelly/Descartes.jl)

Descrates is a research project into the representation of solid geometry. It
is designed to leverage Julia's multiple dispatch and JIT compilation to
create a platform which unifies otherwise desparate geometric representations.
The long term goal is to deliver a geometry kernel suited for the growing
capabilities of digital manufacturing.

Initially the focus will be on the following representations:

- BRep
- Implicit
- CSG
- Analytic CSG
